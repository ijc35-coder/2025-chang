## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "/assets/images/isabel-chang.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am currently a junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I am most interested in design, prototyping, and composite materials and manufacturing. I am the monocoque subteam lead on Cornell FSAE Racing, a project team where we design, manufacture, and race a Formula-One style EV car each June in Michigan against other universities. 

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
