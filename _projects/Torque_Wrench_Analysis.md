Designed a non-ratcheting, 3/8 inch drive instrumented torque wrench rated for 600 in-lbf. Torque was transduced using strain gauges bonded to the outer surfaces of the wrench at high strain locations. 

Learned how to use ANSYS via an FEM analysis of a provided ”baseline” design, used hand calculations to iterate the dimensions and material to meet all requirements, built a CAD model of the design, and then imported the CAD model to ANSYS. Once in ANSYS I performed the stress analysis, to ensure the design met the requirements and determined the torque wrench sensitivity.

Design requirements: 
    •	Attain at least 1.0 mV/V output at the rated torque of 600 in-lbf.
	•	Safety factor of Xo = 4 for yield or brittle failure
	•	Safety factor of XK = 2 for crack growth from an assumed crack of depth 0.04 inches
	•	Fatigue stress safety factor of XS = 1.5.
