As the monocoque subteam lead, I am currently responsible for the design, manufacturing, and integration of the moncooque, or composite frame of the vehicle, on Cornell FSAE Racing during the Fall 2025-Spring 2026 school year. I am also responsible for overlooking the design and manufacturing of the protective structures as a subteam lead. 

The monocoque is an intensive part that requires knowing the mounting locations, bolt size, and loading conditions of every other system that integrates with the car. This integration includes the suspension, ergonomics, aerodynamics, powertrain peripherals, accumulator, and low voltage subteams. There are over 60 individial parts that mount to the monocoque that I must be aware of as the designer. 



The monocoque also drives the entire team's timeline, as full vehicle integration cannot begin without the monocoque physically existing. As the sole designer I set rigid deadlines to ensure that the monocoque completion date would fit within the rigid testing schedule our team aims to accomplish before competition in June.



This PDF goes into detail of the work I have done over the past year to ensure every other part on the car, most notably the suspension, accumulator, low voltage harness, cooling system, and inverters, can be fully integrated with the frame of the car.
