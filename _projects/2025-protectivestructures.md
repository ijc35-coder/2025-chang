As the monocoque subteam lead, I am currently responsible for the design, manufacturing, and integration of the moncooque, or composite frame of the vehicle, on Cornell FSAE Racing during the Fall 2025-Spring 2026 school year. I am also responsible for overlooking the design and manufacturing of the protective structures as a subteam lead. 

The monocoque is an intensive part that requires knowing the mounting locations, bolt size, and loading conditions of every other system that integrates with the car. This integration includes the suspension, ergonomics, aerodynamics, powertrain peripherals, accumulator, and low voltage subteams. There are over 60 individial parts that mount to the monocoque that I must be aware of as the designer. 

## Monocoque Design-to-Manufacturing Process

The design and manufacturing of the carbon-fiber monocoque followed a multi-stage workflow requiring close coordination between the torsionally stiff design, manufacturing constraints, and full multi-system level integration. As the sole monocoque designer, I owned the process from CAD through final layup and cure. Each step required careful time management and planning to ensure the monocoque completion date gave the team enough time to fully integrate each system with the monocoque and have three full months of drive days to test vehicle performance before competition in June.

### 1. CAD Design
Designed the new year's monocoque geometry, incorporating packaging constraints and flat mounting interfaces for all vehicle subsystems while eliminating unnecessary features to shave off as much weight as possible from the previous design.

### 2. Plug Development
Collaborated with external manufacturers to route monocoque top and bottom plugs directly from created CAD models. Sourced high-density polyurethane foam for plug fabrication. Verified all mounting locations and bolt selections with over 30 part designers. Designed and printed custom 3D-printed jigs to accurately locate and fixture all mounting holes on the monocoque.

### 3. Plug Post-Processing
Performed extensive sanding and surface preparation on the top and bottom plugs, followed by Duratec coating to achieve a high-quality surface finish suitable for mold transfer.

### 4. Ply Schedule Development & Material Testing
Developed laminate ply schedules for carbon-fiber skins and aluminum honeycomb cores. Fabricated and tested composite panels using three-point bend tests and perimeter shear tests to validate stiffness and strength of schedules.

### 5. Mold Fabrication
Manufactured the top and bottom monocoque molds through two wet layup processes. Post-processed molds to ensure a smooth, defect-free surface capable of producing consistent, high-quality composite parts.

### 6. Monocoque Manufacturing
Over a two-week intensive manufacturing period, completed carbon-fiber and aluminum honeycomb layups and vacuum bagging operations using the completed molds, resulting in a torsionally stiff, reliable monocoque ready for vehicle integration and testing.

This PDF goes into detail of the work I have done over the past year to ensure every other part on the car, most notably the suspension, accumulator, low voltage harness, cooling system, and inverters, can be fully integrated with the frame of the car.
