I was responsible for the design, manufacturing, and integration of the protective structures on Cornell FSAE Racing during the Fall 2024-Spring 2025 school year. The protective structures included the roll hoops (main roll hoop and braces, front roll hoop) and front protection (anti-intrusion plate and impact attenutator). The point of the protective structures is to ensure that the driver and car remain safe in the event of a crash or if the car rolls over.

The first part of this design process involved creating preliminary CAD designs of the roll hoops in order to optimize weight savings. Once the mounting locations on to the monocoque were decided, the next steps were to create mounts and braces in CAD.
