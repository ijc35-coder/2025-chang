My main contributions to this project include assisting with the dissection, organizing the photos and videos we took as we dissected the hedge trimmer, and performing the calculations on the venturi. Dissecting the hedge trimmer was a large group effort. Once the machine was fully dissected, I created a slideshow and organized all photos by steps and components. When I realized some key photos were missing, I went back into the lab to snap a few more. I also took a few measurements of the venturi and piston assembly, which I then used to calculate the pressure drop in the venturi.
