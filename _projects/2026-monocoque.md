As the monocoque subteam lead, I am currently responsible for the design, manufacturing, and integration of the Moncooque on Cornell FSAE Racing during the Fall 2025-Spring 2026 school year. I am also responsible for overlooking the design and manufacturing of the protective structures as subteam lead.
